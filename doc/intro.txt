is a library that enables to drive LEGO® mindstorm robots from OCaml
through a Bluetooth or USB connection.

{2 How to connect the brick through bluetooth}

You need to create a serial port connection using the instructions
below for your platform.  Then use {!Mindstorm.connect_bluetooth} to
create a handle for the brick.

{3 Linux}

First make sure your kernel has bluetooth support (this is likely) and
that the bluez and bluez-gnome (or kdebluetooth) pakages are
installed.  You should see a bluetooth applet icon.  Then do (the
text after the $ sign is what you type, underneath is the answer):

{v
	$ hcitool scan
	Scanning ...
        	00:16:53:03:A5:32     NXT
v}

to discover the address of your brick.  In the file
/etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf, put in the "options" section

{v
        security auto;
        pin_helper /usr/bin/bluez-pin
v}

Finally use [Mindstorm.connect_bluetooth "00:16:53:03:A5:32"] to
establish the connection (of course, replace "00:16:53:03:A5:32" by
your actual bluetooth address) -- the first time, the brick will ask
you to enter a code and the bluetooth applet will pop up a box in
which you need to copy the very same code (this is to forbid unwanted
connections).


{3 MacOS X}

We follow here the instructions
"{{:http://juju.org/articles/2006/10/22/bluetooth-serial-port-to-nxt-in-osx}Bluetooth
Serial Port To NXT in OSX}":
{ol 
{- Turn on the NXT brick and make sure bluetooth is on (you should 
   see a bluetooth icon at the top left corner);}
{- Click the bluetooth icon in the menubar, select "Setup bluetooth device";}
{- When it asks for Select Device Type, choose "Any device";}
{- Select [NXT] (or whatever your brick is called but [NXT] is the factory
    setting so we'll use that from now on) from the list and click continue;}
{- The NXT will beep and ask for a passkey, choose 1234 (the default but
   you can choose anything you like) and press the orange button;}
{- Click continue in OSX, enter same passkey as above (1234 by default);}
{- The NXT will beep again, press orange button to use 1234 again;}
{- The mac will complain "There were no supported services found on your 
   device"; don't worry about that and click continue and then click Quit;}
{- In OSX click the bluetooth icon, select "Open bluetooth
   preferences", you should see [NXT] (or whatever your brick is
   called) listed, select it, then click "Edit Serial Ports";}
{- It should show [NXT-DevB-1] (replace [NXT] by the name of your
   brick), if not click add, use Port Name: [NXT-DevB-1], Device
   Service: Dev B, Port type: RS-232.  Click Apply.}}

You're done! You should now have a [/dev/tty.NXT-DevB-1].

Now you can connect to the brick using [Mindstorm.connect_bluetooth
"/dev/tty.NXT-DevB-1"].  Beware that if you rename the brick with
{!Mindstorm.set_brick_name}, you will have to change the TTY device
accordingly.


{3 Windows}

From windows, open the bluetooth control panel, create a new
connection to the NXT brick, tight click on your connection and select
"details" to see which serial port is used, for example COM40.  Then
use [Mindstorm.connect_bluetooth "\\\\.\\COM40"].

Windows Vista uses different ports for outgoinf and incoming
connections (e.g. COM4 for outgoing connections and COM5 for incoming
ones).  With this library, you must use the outgoing port.

{2 How to connect the brick through USB}

{3 Linux}

Create a [lego] group, add your user to it and create a file
[/etc/udev/rules.d/70-lego.rules] containing

{v
	# Lego NXT                                               -*-conf-*-
	BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0694", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660"
	
	# Links for specific bricks (use udevinfo to find the serial)
	SYSFS{idVendor}=="0694", SYSFS{serial}=="xxxxxxxxxxxx", SYMLINK+="lego"
v}


{3 MacOS X}

{3 Windows}

you need the LEGO® Mindstorms NXT software installed, as its USB
drivers are used. ???
