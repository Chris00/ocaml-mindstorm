{2 How to connect the brick through bluetooth}

You need to create a serial port connection using the instructions
below for your platform.  Then use {!Mindstorm.connect_bluetooth} to
create a handle for the brick.

{3 Linux}

First make sure your kernel has bluetooth support (this is likely) and
that the bluez and bluez-gnome (or kdebluetooth) pakages are
installed.  You should see a bluetooth applet icon.  Then do (the
text after the $ sign is what you type, underneath is the answer):

{v
	$ hcitool scan
	Scanning ...
        	00:16:53:03:A5:32     NXT
v}

to discover the address of your brick.  In the file
/etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf, put in the "options" section

{v
        security auto;
        pin_helper /usr/bin/bluez-pin
v}

Finally use [Mindstorm.connect_bluetooth "00:16:53:03:A5:32"] to
establish the connection (of course, replace "00:16:53:03:A5:32" by
your actual bluetooth address) -- the first time, the brick will ask
you to enter a code and the bluetooth applet will pop up a box in
which you need to copy the very same code (this is to forbid unwanted
connections).


{3 MacOS X}

See
{{:http://juju.org/articles/2006/08/01/mindstorms-nxt-bluetooth-on-osx}
Mindstorms NXT Bluetooth on OSX}.

{3 Windows}

From windows, open the bluetooth control panel, create a new
connection to the NXT brick, tight click on your connection and select
"details" to see which serial port is used, for example COM40.  Then
use [Mindstorm.connect_bluetooth "\\\\.\\COM40"].

{2 How to connect the brick through USB}

{3 Linux}

Create a [lego] group, add your user to it and create a file
[/etc/udev/rules.d/70-lego.rules] containing

{v
	# Lego NXT                                               -*-conf-*-
	BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0694", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660"
	
	# Links for specific bricks (use udevinfo to find the serial)
	SYSFS{idVendor}=="0694", SYSFS{serial}=="xxxxxxxxxxxx", SYMLINK+="lego"
v}


{3 MacOS X}

{3 Windows}

you need the LEGO® Mindstorms NXT software installed, as its USB
drivers are used. ???
