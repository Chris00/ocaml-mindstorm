    for USB. *)

(** [recv conn n] reads a "package" of length [n] and return it.  For
    bluetooth, the prefix of 2 bytes indicating the length are also
    read but not returned (and not counted in [n]).  [recv] checks the
    status byte using [check_status_fn] and possibly raise an
    exception (it is the task of [check_status_fn] to do that),
    regardless of the value of [check_status] (this is to allow to
    override [check_status] locally). *)

    [conn] and puts them in [buf] starting at position [ofs].  It does
    NOT read the bluetooth prefix bytes, so should not be used for
    packages but only for additional data. *)
