This is a Connect 4 AI core engine. Please download Velena for the whole 
documentation.

Velena can be found at the following adresses via Internet:

Greetings

During Velena development I have been helped by many persons:

This program is based on the knowledged approach of L.Victor Allis which 
designed and  implemented a sophisticated AI engine in a program called 
Victor. Velena is basically the same, except that even newer concepts and 
techniques were introduced in order to reduce the problem complexity (of 
solving the game) to a more tractable factor of magnitude. Moreover Velena 
is available to anyone, while Victor (currently) is not. I thank L.Victor 
Allis for his support while I developed Velena and for the theory he made 
for solving Connect Four. Without him this program wouldn't have come to light. 

I also thank Filippo Ghilardi who helped me to build the opening book data base
which took several days of work on his Pentium 133 computer, and Davide Mazza 
who created the Velena intro logo (MSDOS version).
